# Fastify &amp; ReactJS project template

What needs to be done generally:
- Create an executable package for creating the app with `npx` like: `npx create-fastify-and-react-project`
- And a CLI for managing like:
  - `some-cli client:add page`
  - `some-cli server:add route --ws / --http`
  - `some-cli db:add table` etc.

-> Put more effort first to cerating issues and providing refferences & samples
